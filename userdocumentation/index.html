<h1>User Documentation</h1>

<p>This section contains instructions on how you can implement various operations ranging from registering onto SynBioHub to uploading your genetic designs on SynBioHub, by using the user interface of SynBioHub. The sub-sections are as follows:</p>
<h2 id="1-searching-for-information">1. Searching for Information</h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways to search for information in SynBioHub, such as using keywords, sequences, advanced searches and  SPARQL queries. They&rsquo;re explained in detail as follows:</p>
<h3 id="11-keyword-search">1.1 Keyword Search</h3>
<p>To search amongst various records, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to SynBioHub&rsquo;s home page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the search box, enter the keywords for the record you want to search for and click on the search button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, you shall be directed to a list of records matching the keywords that you&rsquo;ve entered. For each record, the first thing that is displayed is the name. Just below the name, the ID, version and type of the record shall be displayed. Just below, you&rsquo;ll be able to see a brief description about the record provided by the owner of that particular record. On the right hand side, there is an indicator displaying whether it is a <strong>public</strong>, <strong>private</strong> or a <strong>remote</strong> record. Being private means that the record is available on a private repository i.e, to a specific user only and if it is labeled as public means it is available to all the users of SynBioHub. If the record is available to all the users but on another instance of SynBioHub, then it shall be labeled as remote</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you see the record you want, you can select it else, you can select next or any of the other page numbers to navigate to the other pages to look for the record you desire amongst other records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On this page, you&rsquo;re also able to see other search options, such as sequence, advanced or SPARQL search, which are described in detail in the upcoming sections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="12-sequence-search">1.2 Sequence Search</h3>
<p>On the search results page, there is button labeled as <strong>sequence search</strong>. Clicking on that button will direct you to a page containing a list of sequence search options. To search using a sequence, you can provide the values for the options, as described in the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Enter Sequence</td>
<td>Enter the sequence or upload a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA">FASTA</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format">FASTQ</a></strong> file, by clicking the choose file option just below the box. This shall search only for exact matches of the sequence. Your entry must be the first key/value pair</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Search Method</td>
<td>You can choose the perspective of your search. You can perform a <strong>global</strong> search or an <strong>exact</strong> search. The exact search shall display, those records which are an exact match to the sequences that you&rsquo;ve entered and the global search search will display those results which have even the smallest of the similarities to the sequence that you&rsquo;ve entered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of Results</td>
<td>You may customise the number of results, the value for which must not exceed 10,000. This translates into the maximum number of hits to accept before stopping the search. Kindly note that, higher the value, the longer the runtime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimum Sequence Length</td>
<td>You need to enter the minimum sequence length. This value basically specifies the minimum length of the sequence, which you want to search for. Values for this parameter should not exceed 100,000.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximum Sequence Length</td>
<td>You need to enter the maximum sequence length. This value basically specifies the maximum length of the sequence, which you want to search for. Values for this parameter should not exceed 100,000.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td># of failed hits before stopping</td>
<td>Then, you need to enter the maximum number of non-matching target sequences, that are to be considered before the search is halted. This option works in pair with the flag above. The search process sorts the target sequences by decreasing number of k-mers they have in common with the query sequence, using that information as a proxy for sequence similarity. After pairwise alignments, if none of the first x examined target sequences pass the acceptation criteria, the search process stops for that query (no hit). If this flag is set to a higher value, more target sequences are considered. If the flag above and this flag are both set to 0, the complete database is searched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Percent Match</td>
<td>Then, we have is the <em>percentage match</em>, which has a value between 0 and 1. This is the value of pairwise identity that must match with the sequence, otherwise the sequence is rejected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pairwise Identity Definition</td>
<td>You may select the value for this attribute from the following options: 1) <strong>Default</strong>: Edits distance excluding the terminal gaps,   2) <strong>CD-HIT definition</strong>: Considers the following ratio: (matching columns) / (shortest sequence length),   3) <strong>Marine Biological Lab definition</strong>: counts each gap opening (internal or terminal) as a single mismatch, whether or not the gap was extended: 1.0 - [(mismatches + gap openings)/(longest sequence length)],   4) <strong>BLAST Definition</strong>: equivalent to edit distance for global pairwise alignments</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<p>After filling up the desired options, press the <strong>search</strong> button to get the search results.</p>
<h3 id="13-advanced-search">1.3 Advanced Search</h3>
<p>On the search results page, there is button labeled as <strong>advanced search</strong>. Clicking on that button will direct you to a page containing a list of advanced search options. To search using advanced parameters, you can provide the values for the option as described in the table below. The records that&rsquo;ll be displayed will match all of the criteria, that you&rsquo;ll fill in. Kindly note that you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> need to fill in all of the options. The options are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Object Type</td>
<td>The type of the record you want to search for i.e, a collection, design, activity, etc&hellip;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Creator</td>
<td>The username of the record&rsquo;s creator</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Created After and Created Before</td>
<td>the timeframe between which the record was created. Make sure to enter the dates in the <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong> format</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Modified After Modified Before</td>
<td>The timeframe between the record may had been modified. Make sure to enter the dates in the <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong> format</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ID/Name/Description</td>
<td>Enter the ID or the name or the description of the record, which you want to search for</td>

<tr>
<td>Role</td>
<td>select the <strong>role</strong> of the record from this dropdown menu. It contains various sub-categories of <strong><a href="https://igem.org/Main_Page">igem</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/miso/current_release/term/SO:0000316">SO</a></strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collections</td>
<td>You may select any number of collections, based on your convenience. To select a collection, click on the value attribute of collection and select it from the drop down menu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customisable Filters</td>
<td>You may apply customised filters for the design you want to search for. For that purpose, a few blank filtering columns have been provided. As soon as you&rsquo;ll click on an empty filter on the left hand side, a drop down menu shall appear having various parameters for filtering. These parameters are basically, the properties for filtering the records. Select the property that you want your record to be filtered by, and then click on filter. This shall reload the page and then select the value of the filter, from the drop down on the right hand side. You may provide as many as 5 customised filters which&rsquo;er optional</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<p>After selecting the desired options for performing a search using advanced parameters, click <strong>search</strong>. This will return the records after comprehending all the details that you&rsquo;ve entered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just below, there is an option to create a <strong>new collection</strong> as well. If you wish to create a collection from your search results, you need to fill in the following items:</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option Name</th>
<th>Description</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collection Version</td>
<td>This is the alphanumeric string which is associated with the submission.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve filled in all the available options, click on <strong>create collection</strong>. This will return the search results to you, in the form a private collection.</p>
<h3 id="14-sparql-search">1.4 SPARQL Search</h3>
<p>On the search results page, there is button labeled as <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a></strong>. Clicking on that button will direct you to the SPARQL page. Since, SPARQL is a query language, hence it&rsquo;ll query Synbiohub&rsquo;s databases for the designs that you&rsquo;re looking for. On the SPARQL page, you can select the graph that is from <strong>private</strong> or <strong>public</strong>. Here, <strong>public</strong> means searching amongst the public submissions, that can be viewed by and <strong>private</strong> means, the ones that are your personal collections.</p>
<p>In the box provided just below graphs dropdown, enter the SPARQL query. Following is an example that selects all sbol components that have an SO role type. It returns the part title, part role, part display id, part uri, and the total number of parts returned by the query. If you want to search for other types of designs, just replace SBOL with your preferred type:</p>
<pre><code>

  }

</code></pre><p>After writing your SPARQL query, just click <strong>submit query</strong>. After you click on <strong>submit query</strong>, a list of records matching with SPARQL query shall be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="15-searching-on-a-record-page">1.5 Searching on a Record Page</h3>
<p>On a record page, under the search button, you may find the following options:-</p>
<h4 id="151-searching-for-uses">1.5.1 Searching for Uses</h4>
<p>This returns other records that refers to this particular record which you&rsquo;re currently viewing. For example, if this is an engineered region, then it will return all other components that use this as a sub-component.</p>
<h4 id="152-search-for-twin-components">1.5.2 Search for Twin Components</h4>
<p>If the record being viewed is a component, then you&rsquo;ll also have the option to search for <strong>twin</strong> components. A twin is another component that has the same sequence as the object being viewed. So, selecting this option will return all the records having the same sequence as the object that you&rsquo;d be currently viewing.</p>
<h4 id="153-search-for-similar-components">1.5.3 Search for Similar Components</h4>
<p>If the record being viewed is a component and SBOLExplorer is being run on that particular SynBioHub instance, then you&rsquo;ll also have the option to search for <strong>similar</strong> components. A component is similar, when the sequences are close enough, that SBOLExplorer has clustered those 2 components together into the same cluster.</p>
<h2 id="2-viewing--downloading-the-information">2. Viewing &amp; Downloading the Information</h2>
<h3 id="21-viewing-the-information">2.1 Viewing the Information</h3>
<p>There are various types of records on SynBioHub. They&rsquo;ve been divided into the following sub-categories:</p>
<h4 id="211-viewing-a-record">2.1.1. Viewing a Record</h4>
<p>This section consists of a general description of all record pages i.e, this is what a general record page looks like. Additional sections (if any), are further explained in the further sections, under the respective record types.
Once you&rsquo;ve successfully navigated to the record&rsquo;s home page, you&rsquo;ll be able to view the parameters in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name: Represents the name of that particular record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ID and version: The next line represents the ID and the version of that record. Every record has a specific ID associated with it and a version which represents the number of times; it has been modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#type">Type</a></strong>: This specifies the category of biochemical or physical entity. For example DNA, protein, or small molecule that a ComponentDefinition object abstracts for the purpose of engineering design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated from: Represents the source from where that record had been generated from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we&rsquo;ve got five clickable options, that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/userdocumentation/#32-downloading-the-information">Download</a></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/userdocumentation/#1-searching-for-information">Search</a></strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/userdocumentation/#6-data-sharing-mechanisms">Share</a></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Back</strong>: This option navigates back to the main page of the collection, which that particular record is a part of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/userdocumentation/#6-add-to-an-existing-collection">Add to a collection</a></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we have the details of that record. This consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#type">Type</a></strong>: This specifies the category of biochemical or physical entity. For example DNA, protein, or small molecule that a ComponentDefinition object abstracts for the purpose of engineering design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#role">Role</a></strong>: Clarifies the potential function of an entity in a biochemical or physical context. When it is used for ComponentDefinitions, it MUST identify terms from ontologies that are consistent with the types property of the ComponentDefinition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#Sequence">Sequence</a></strong>: The purpose of the Sequence class is to represent the primary structure of a ComponentDefinition object and the manner in which it is encoded. This representation is accomplished by means of the elements property and encoding property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, you can view reference as well as citations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we have the section named, <strong>other properties</strong>. This consists of the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="www.ontobee.org/ontology/OBI?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0002110">Ontology for Biomedical Investigations(OBI)</a></strong>: A centrally registered identifier symbol used to uniquely identify objects given by International DOI Foundation. The DOI system is particularly used for electronic documents such as journal articles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SynBioHub#Owned_by: Username of the design owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SynBioHub#TopLevel</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, we have the section titled as, <strong>Member of these collections</strong>. This section contains the list of collection&rsquo;s to which that particular resource belongs to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we have the <strong>attachments</strong> page. In this section, you can view the various attachments, of a resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we have the <strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#Interaction">Interactions</a></strong> section. Interaction basically, provides a more detailed description of how the FunctionalComponent objects of a ModuleDefinition are intended to work together. It has a table consisting of the following attributes:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table>

<td>1) <strong>Interaction</strong>: Provides more detailed description of how the FunctionalComponent objects of a ModuleDefinition are intended to work together.   2) <strong>Participation</strong>: Each Participation represents how a particular FunctionalComponent behaves in its parent Interaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#definition">Participant Definition</a></strong></td>
<td>The definition property is a REQUIRED URI that refers to the ComponentDefinition of the ComponentInstance. As described in the previous section, this ComponentDefinition effectively provides information about the types and roles of the ComponentInstance.</td>

<p>There may be additional clickable sections after the attachments menu. These have been added via, <strong><a href="https://github.com/SynBioHub/Plugin-Visual-Seqviz">visualisation plugins</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we have a section, titled <strong>Member of these collection</strong>, which displays the collection, of which that particular record is a part of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="212-viewing-a-collection">2.1.2 Viewing a collection</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#Collection">Collection</a></strong>, basically groups together a set of TopLevel objects that have something in common.</p>
<p>On a collection&rsquo;s home page, other than the details mentioned in the general section, you&rsquo;ll be able to view a section titled, <strong>members</strong>.
This sections basically contains, the list of records that is included in this particular section.
A general description of this section is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Filtering the Table</strong>: The first parameter in this section is of filtering the table of contents. This is basically a dropdown menu, which contains various parameters base upon which the table of contents can be filtered. It contains various options such as showing all objects, showing only root objects, biopic:complex, etc..  You may select the option of your choice, from this dropdown menu and then click on filter. This will filter the table and display only those contents which&rsquo;er as per the parameter that you have selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of Entries</strong>: This is also a dropdown menu, which contains certain integer strings. The number of records you want to be displayed on a single page, can be controlled by this option. So, you can choose the value as per your own convenience, which in turn shall display that many records on a single page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search</strong>: By using this search option, you can search for the records of your own choice, just by providing its name. Therefore, for searching a record contained in the table, you need to provide its exact name string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Table</strong>: Then we have is the table of contents. It contains the records that are in that very particular collection. This is a sortable table and can be sorted on the basis of multiple parameters ranging from identifier, type or description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The header of the table as explained as follows:</p>

<h4 id="213-viewing-a-module">2.1.3 Viewing a Module</h4>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#ModuleDefinition">Module</a></strong>, basically represents a grouping of structural and functional entities in a biological design.
Once you&rsquo;ve successfully navigated to the Module&rsquo;s home page, other than the parameters described in the general section,you&rsquo;ll be able to view a few other the parameters, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: The record type, as is obvious will be displayed as <strong>Module</strong>. A <strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#ModuleDefinition">Module</a></strong>, basically represents a grouping of structural and functional entities in a biological design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just below the clickable options, the VisBol navigates is located, which displays the structure of that particular module. VisBOL Navigator also has zooming capabilities. This, graphically represents the structure of the module. By hovering your pointer over this structure, you can view the following attributes of that particular module i.e, type of resource, identifier, name and role of the module.</p>
<p>Then, what we have is the section titled, <strong><a href="https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#FunctionalComponent">functional components</a></strong>. A FunctionalComponent is an instance of a ComponentDefinition being used as part of a ModuleDefinition. The ModuleDefinition describes how the that describes how the FunctionalComponent interacts with others and summarizes their aggregate function. The parameters included in this section are described in the table below:</p>

<td>1) <strong>Access</strong>: The access property is a REQUIRED URI that indicates whether the ComponentInstance can be referred to remotely by a MapsTo on another ComponentInstance or Module contained by a different parent ComponentDefinition or ModuleDefinition (one that does not contain this ComponentInstance).  2) <strong>Direction</strong>:Each FunctionalComponent MUST specify via the direction property whether it serves as an input, output, both, or neither for its parent ModuleDefinition object.</td>

<td>1) <strong>Definition</strong>: The definition property is a REQUIRED URI that refers to the ComponentDefinition of the ComponentInstance. ComponentDefinition effectively provides information about the types and roles of the ComponentInstance.  2) <strong>MapsTo</strong>: When ComponentDefinition and ModuleDefinition objects are composed into structural and functional hierarchies using ComponentInstance and Module objects, it is often the case that some ComponentInstance objects are intended to represent the same entity in the overall design. The purpose of the MapsTo class is to make these identity relationships clear and explicit. For example, consider a ModuleDefinition for a genetic inverter that includes a FunctionalComponent for an abstract repressor protein. When this ModuleDefinition is instantiated within a “higher level” ModuleDefinition that includes a FunctionalComponent for a LacI protein, the MapsTo object can be used to indicate that the repressor protein in the first ModuleDefinition is LacI in the context of the composite design.</td>

<p>Click on <strong>grant ownership</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="8-administration">8. Administration</h2>
<p>Note: <strong>The administration section will only be available, if you&rsquo;re using a SynBioHub local instance. If you&rsquo;re using a global instance, such as <a href="https://synbiohub.org/">this</a> one, then the administration section won&rsquo;t be available unless you have privileged access to SynBioHub.</strong></p>
<p>To access the admin page, the following steps need to be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the home page of your SynbioHub local instance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>SendGrid From Email</strong>:  Here, you can enter the email, which you can use for sending emails.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="85-plugins">8.5 Plugins</h4>
<p>On this page, you can configure the <strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/plugins/">plugins </a></strong> which you want to use. Plugins are modular stand-alone additions to SynBioHub. They function in a way that is similar to browser extensions. They can be installed separately from the browser/SynBioHub and provide additional ‘custom’ functionality to the browser/SynBioHub experience despite having a completely separate code base from the browser/SynBioHub. Though, they seem integrated to the user.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re broadly classified into 3 types, which are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Submit: Submit plugins are available to use from the submit endpoint. They work by taking in the file that is uploaded in the submit and processing it to return SBOL to the SynBioHub endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual: Visual plugins are available on all ‘endpoint’ pages, for example pages for components, sequences, activities, etc. Visual plugins return html to be displayed on the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download: Download plugins are available on all ‘endpoint’ pages, for example pages for components, sequences, activities, etc. Download plugins return some kind of file which is downloaded by the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, the plugins are divided into 3 categories all having the same attributes. The attributes, which need to be filled up are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name: This is the name which you want to give to your plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL: In this column, you need to enter the URL for your plugin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After filling both of the columns click on <strong>save</strong>, in order to save your plugin.</p>
<h4 id="86-registries">8.6 Registries</h4>
<p>SynBioHub also supports the Web of Registries concept i.e, the idea of multiple separate repositories linked together by shared common semantics. In the case of SynBioHub, SBOL is used to support the common exchange of data, thus positioning SynBioHub to support the development of synthetic biology workflows by acting as a source and a storage facility for designs.</p>
<p>Hence, Web Of registries enables communication between SynBioHub instances. Sharing designs between instances of SynBioHub is also further facilitated via the Web of Registries service. Federated SynBioHub instances can reference parts in the public graph of other federated instances. In order to support this federation, the Web of Registries service maintains information about all SynBioHub registries, such as their name, description, administrator email, URI prefix, and uniform resource locator(URL).</p>
<p>Any SynBioHub can access the Web Of Registries to determine information about all registered SynBioHub instances. If a design references a part within another synbiohub instance, the information about this part can be fetched in order to render this design information locally and provide links to the corresponding design information page for this part.</p>
<p>When a new SynBioHub instance wishes to join the Web of Registries, it sends its information to the Web of Registries service, and all the Web of Registries curators are alerted via email that there is a new repository pending approval. Once the repository has been approved, its information is broadcast to all other registries in the Web of Registries. Anybody can access the current list of registries through an HTTP GET request. Once registered, an instance of SynBioHub is able to locate designs within any other instance that is registered with the Web of Registries.</p>
<p>SynBioHub demonstrates the application of this harmonized data exchange through existing repositories, hence envisaging a wider, integrated ecosystem of biological part information shared across a plethora of different repositories with different capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On this page, you can configure the registry for your local instance. To configure the registry for your local instance, enter the administrator email in the column just besides the web-of-registries link. After entering the admin email, click on <strong>submit</strong> and this would configure the admin email for the registries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 2 options given just below the local web of registries sub-section, which are:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve from web of registries</strong>: This option shall retrieve the web of registries that are already existing globally, locally onto you instance, if in case you delete them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add registry</strong>: This shall enable you to add a registry onto your instance. For adding, click on this option. Then, a popup shall appear. Subsequently, enter the registry URI prefix and the Registry URL. Finally, click on <strong>submit</strong>. This will add an already existing registry of SynBioHub, to the list of registries on you SynBioHub local instance.</p>

<h4 id="88-sbolexplorer">8.8 SBOLExplorer</h4>
<p>SBOLExplorer is a service that simplifies the process of analysing and searching for parts within genetic design repositories.</p>
<p>Once you click on the <strong>SBOLExplorer</strong> option, you can view the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first option is that of <strong>SBOLExplorer</strong> endpoint. Here, you can enter and save your SBOLExplorer endpoint for your local instance. Also, make sure that any of the endpoints you enter end with <strong>\</strong>.</li>
<li>Then on the right, you shall see the <strong>searching using SBOL explorer</strong>*. You need to Check the this option to enable the SBOLExplorer.</li>
<li>Then, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the option of selecting between, <strong><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/19/2460/230188">Usearch</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075697/">Vsearch</a></strong>. They&rsquo;re explained in detail as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usearch: UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vsearch: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Next, you can view the start and the end of the last index update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, you can choose whether you want to allow the automatic updating of index or not. If you check this option, the you&rsquo;ll also have the option of choosing the frequency of index update.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you have the option of, whether you want to allow the option of a distributed search or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, you can select the  value of <strong><a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/page-rank/">page rank tolerance</a></strong>. PageRank basically is an algorithm that measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes. It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbours or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also an option of choosing a value of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLUST">UClust clustering identity</a></strong>. UCLUST is an algorithm designed to cluster nucleotide or amino-acid sequences into clusters based on sequence similarity. The algorithm was published in 2010 and implemented in a program also named UCLUST. The algorithm is described by the author as following two simple clustering criteria, in regard to the requested similarity threshold T. The first criterion states that any given cluster&rsquo;s centroid sequence will have a similarity smaller than T to any other clusters' centroid sequence. The second criterion states that each member sequence in a given cluster will have similarity to the cluster&rsquo;s centroid sequence that is equal or greater than T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you can also input a value for the <strong><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/1.1/ece-administering-endpoints.html">elasticsearch endpoints</a></strong>. For applications without SSL or HTTPS protocol support, you can use a local endpoint with the HTTP protocol, which in turn connects to your Elastic Cloud Enterprise cluster or to Kibana either using the HTTP or the HTTPS protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you have to input a value for the <strong><a href="https://medium.com/virtuoso-blog/what-is-a-virtuoso-sparql-endpoint-and-why-is-it-important-5244df738a3e">SPARQL/Virtuoso endpoints</a></strong>. A Virtuoso SPARQL Endpoint is a feature of every Virtuoso RDBMS instance that offers an HTTP-based Query Service that operates on Entity Relationship Types (Relations) represented as RDF sentence collections using the SPARQL Query Language. These operations may be read- and/or write-oriented and distributed without compromising security, performance, or scalability.</p>

<h4 id="89-sparql">8.9 SPARQL</h4>
<p>On the search results page, there is button labeled as <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a></strong>. Clicking on that button will direct you to the SPARQL page. Since, SPARQL is a query language, hence it&rsquo;ll query Synbiohub&rsquo;s databases for the designs that you&rsquo;re looking for. On the SPARQL page, you can select the graph that is from <strong>private</strong> or <strong>public</strong>. Here, <strong>public</strong> means searching amongst the public submissions, that can be viewed by and <strong>private</strong> means, the ones that are your personal collections.</p>
<p>In the box provided just below graphs dropdown, enter the SPARQL query. Following is an example that selects all sbol components that have an SO role type. It returns the part title, part role, part display id, part uri, and the total number of parts returned by the query. If you want to search for other types of designs, just replace SBOL with your preferred type:</p>
