</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <em>Settings</em> options on left hand side of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, select the <em>Create an API key option</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;ll prompt you to give your API key a name. Also, you can customize the API key permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After completing these steps, click on Create and View.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The API key is shown only for once due to security reasons, so try to save it at a safe place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your API key has been created, and hence ready to use!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SendGrid API key</strong>: For generating an API key, you need to have a sendgrid account. To sign-up for sendgrid and hence generating an API key, click <a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/setup/#setting-up-sendgrid">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SendGrid From Email</strong>:  Here, you can enter the email, which you can use for sending emails.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="85-plugins">8.5 Plugins</h2>
<p>On this page, you can configure the <strong><a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/plugins/">plugins </a></strong> which you want to use. Plugins are modular stand-alone additions to SynBioHub. They function in a way that is similar to browser extensions. They can be installed separately from the browser/SynBioHub and provide additional ‘custom’ functionality to the browser/SynBioHub experience despite having a completely separate code base from the browser/SynBioHub. Though, they seem integrated to the user.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re broadly classified into 3 types, which are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Submit: Submit plugins are available to use from the submit endpoint. They work by taking in the file that is uploaded in the submit and processing it to return SBOL to the SynBioHub endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual: Visual plugins are available on all ‘endpoint’ pages, for example pages for components, sequences, activities, etc. Visual plugins return html to be displayed on the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download: Download plugins are available on all ‘endpoint’ pages, for example pages for components, sequences, activities, etc. Download plugins return some kind of file which is downloaded by the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, the plugins are divided into 3 categories all having the same attributes. The attributes, which need to be filled up are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name: This is the name which you want to give to your plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL: In this column, you need to enter the URL for your plugin. For more information about plugin urls see Adding plugins to the admin panel under the <a href="https://synbiohub.github.io/plugins/#22-installation">installation</a> section</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After filling both of the columns click on <strong>save</strong>, in order to save your plugin.</p>
<h2 id="86-registries">8.6 Registries</h2>
<p>SynBioHub also supports the Web of Registries concept i.e, the idea of multiple separate repositories linked together by shared common semantics. In the case of SynBioHub, SBOL is used to support the common exchange of data, thus positioning SynBioHub to support the development of synthetic biology workflows by acting as a source and a storage facility for designs.</p>
<p>Hence, Web Of registries enables communication between SynBioHub instances. Sharing designs between instances of SynBioHub is also further facilitated via the Web of Registries service. Federated SynBioHub instances can reference parts in the public graph of other federated instances. In order to support this federation, the Web of Registries service maintains information about all SynBioHub registries, such as their name, description, administrator email, URI prefix, and uniform resource locator(URL).</p>
<p>Any SynBioHub can access the Web Of Registries to determine information about all registered SynBioHub instances. If a design references a part within another synbiohub instance, the information about this part can be fetched in order to render this design information locally and provide links to the corresponding design information page for this part.</p>
<p>When a new SynBioHub instance wishes to join the Web of Registries, it sends its information to the Web of Registries service, and all the Web of Registries curators are alerted via email that there is a new repository pending approval. Once the repository has been approved, its information is broadcast to all other registries in the Web of Registries. Anybody can access the current list of registries through an HTTP GET request. Once registered, an instance of SynBioHub is able to locate designs within any other instance that is registered with the Web of Registries.</p>
<p>SynBioHub demonstrates the application of this harmonized data exchange through existing repositories, hence envisaging a wider, integrated ecosystem of biological part information shared across a plethora of different repositories with different capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On this page, you can configure the registry for your local instance. To configure the registry for your local instance, enter the administrator email in the column just besides the web-of-registries link. After entering the admin email, click on <strong>submit</strong> and this would configure the admin email for the registries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 2 options given just below the local web of registries sub-section, which are:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve from web of registries</strong>: This option shall retrieve the web of registries that are already existing globally, locally onto you instance, if in case you delete them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add registry</strong>: This shall enable you to add a registry onto your instance. For adding, click on this option. Then, a popup shall appear. Subsequently, enter the registry URI prefix and the Registry URL. Finally, click on <strong>submit</strong>. This will add an already existing registry of SynBioHub, to the list of registries on your SynBioHub local instance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Several local web-of-registries are also given on this page alongside their Synbiohub URL. Here, you have an option to <strong>save</strong> as well as <strong>delete</strong> the already existing registries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="87-remotes">8.7 Remotes</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of remotes you can configure for SynBioHub i.e, <strong>Benchling</strong> and <strong>ICE</strong>. They&rsquo;re discussed in detail as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://benchling.com/academic">Benchling</a></strong>: Benchling is an integrated software solution for experiment design, note-taking, and molecular biology. It is a free, intelligent research platform with tools for note-taking, molecular biology, and sample tracking. Benchling includes an electronic lab notebook, a molecular biology suite for design and analysis, and a bioregistry to track inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://ice.jbei.org/">ICE</a></strong>: ICE is a registry platform that provides robust data storage for DNA components, integrated tools for part characterization, as well as mechanisms for secure access and information sharing with other users and software tools.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon opening this page for the first time you&rsquo;ll see a message stating: <em>No remotes configured</em>. To configure a remote for your instance, follow the following steps:</p>
<h3 id="871-configuring-a-benchling-remote">8.7.1 Configuring a benchling remote</h3>

<h2 id="88-sbolexplorer">8.8 SBOLExplorer</h2>
<p>SBOLExplorer is a service that simplifies the process of analysing and searching for parts within genetic design repositories.</p>
<p>Once you click on the <strong>SBOLExplorer</strong> option, you can view the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first option is that of <strong>SBOLExplorer</strong> endpoint. Here, you can enter and save your SBOLExplorer endpoint for your local instance. Also, make sure that any of the endpoints you enter end with <strong>\</strong>.</li>
<li>Then on the right, you shall see the <strong>searching using SBOL explorer</strong>*. You need to Check the this option to enable the SBOLExplorer.</li>
<li>Then, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the option of selecting between, <strong><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/19/2460/230188">Usearch</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075697/">Vsearch</a></strong>. They&rsquo;re explained in detail as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usearch: UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vsearch: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Next, you can view the start and the end of the last index update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, you can choose whether you want to allow the automatic updating of index or not. If you check this option, the you&rsquo;ll also have the option of choosing the frequency of index update.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you have the option of, whether you want to allow the option of a distributed search or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, you can select the  value of <strong><a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/page-rank/">page rank tolerance</a></strong>. PageRank basically is an algorithm that measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes. It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbours or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also an option of choosing a value of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLUST">UClust clustering identity</a></strong>. UCLUST is an algorithm designed to cluster nucleotide or amino-acid sequences into clusters based on sequence similarity. The algorithm was published in 2010 and implemented in a program also named UCLUST. The algorithm is described by the author as following two simple clustering criteria, in regard to the requested similarity threshold T. The first criterion states that any given cluster&rsquo;s centroid sequence will have a similarity smaller than T to any other clusters' centroid sequence. The second criterion states that each member sequence in a given cluster will have similarity to the cluster&rsquo;s centroid sequence that is equal or greater than T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you can also input a value for the <strong><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/1.1/ece-administering-endpoints.html">elasticsearch endpoints</a></strong>. For applications without SSL or HTTPS protocol support, you can use a local endpoint with the HTTP protocol, which in turn connects to your Elastic Cloud Enterprise cluster or to Kibana either using the HTTP or the HTTPS protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you have to input a value for the <strong><a href="https://medium.com/virtuoso-blog/what-is-a-virtuoso-sparql-endpoint-and-why-is-it-important-5244df738a3e">SPARQL/Virtuoso endpoints</a></strong>. A Virtuoso SPARQL Endpoint is a feature of every Virtuoso RDBMS instance that offers an HTTP-based Query Service that operates on Entity Relationship Types (Relations) represented as RDF sentence collections using the SPARQL Query Language. These operations may be read- and/or write-oriented and distributed without compromising security, performance, or scalability.</p>
